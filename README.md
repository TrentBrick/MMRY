This project was my first real foray into coding including learning how to use APIs and lots of different software libraries. 

While I got a fully working prototype of the chatbot, I never ended up using it and eventually forgot to renew a Duke VM I was using for hosting. 

The code is pretty messy and I am sure the Facebook API has changed since 2016 but anyone is welcome to use this code to make a chatbot of their own. 

Features include: 
* Chatbot help section
* Ability to create flashcards
* Be tested on pending flashcards (using the SuperMemo2 algorithm)
* Be spammed with some wonderful GIFs when your flashcards are overdue, as a reminder
