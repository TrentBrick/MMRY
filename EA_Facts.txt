Complex life on earth will die out between 0.9-1.5 billion years from now due to the growing luminosity of the sum. In ~3.5 billion the biosphere will be sterilized completely. 
If all complex life including homo sapiens did go extinct now, because we took 1.2 billion years to evolve from simple multicellular organisms there is the chance intelligent life could evolve again but no guarantee that evolution would follow the same path which seems highly unlikely, not only to develop Sapiens but homo Sapiens who were the only genus capable of conquering Earth. 
No matter what, all life in the universe will go extinct in 100 trillion years when the last stars stop shining. This is the heat death of the universe. 
“There have been 15 mass extinctions in the last 500 million years, 5 eliminated more than half of all species inhabiting the Earth”.
“it is possible that we owe our existence to mass extinctions. In particular, the comet that hit Earth 65 mill. Which is believed to have been responsible for killing the dinosaurs and leaving an “ecological niche” for Homo sapiens. 
At least 99.9% of all species to have ever existed on Earth are extinct. 
All other homo’s including the Neanderthals and Floresiensis are extinct - there has already been the extinction of an intelligent species on Earth. 
75,000 years ago, a volcano in Toba, Indonesia spewed ash which lowered land temperatures by 5-15C for several years. This reduced the global human population to possibly as low as only 500 reproducing females and 4,000 people in total. 
Insert fact about how quickly plants die here
And the amount of food stock we have globally. We currently have “a global stockpile equivalent to a two-month supply of grain”
Supervolcano such as this every 50,000 years. 
NASA Spaceguard project receivers only $4 million per annum. 
Deaths from infectious diseases account for ~25% of all deaths worldwide = 15 mill. Per year. 75% of these deaths in SE Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. (CHECK MOST UP TO DATE STATS ON THIS). 
The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, named the Spanish flu, killed at least 20-50 million people. Yet this is overshadowed but WWI which had 19 million fatalities and by the fact that the influenza was only fatal in 2-3% of cases, which suggests if 35 million died and at a 2.5% rate, 1.4 billion were infected. 
Info about how it has been resynthesized and is readily available. 
Life expectancy is now … years, up from 50 in the early 20th century, 33 in Medieval Britain and an estimated 18 during the Bronze Age.
